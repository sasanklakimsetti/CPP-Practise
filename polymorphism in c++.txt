Polymorphism:  Combination of poly + morphs i.e. many forms for one.

Types:

Compiler-time polymorphism  :   Function overloading, Operator Overloading

Run time polymorphism  :  Virtual function


1. Function Overloading:
   
*When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, then the function are said to be overloaded, hence this is known as Function overloading
*Functions can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments. In simple terms, it is a feature of object-oriented programming providing many functions that have the same name but distinct parameters when numerous tasks are listed under one function name.
*There are certainn rules of function overloading that should be followed while overloading a function.


2.  Operator Overloading: 

*The ability to provide the operators with special  meaning for a data type.



Runtime Polymorphism: 

*Runtime polymorphism also referred to as dynamic polymorphism is usually achieved by function overriding.
*Function overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class.
*The base function is said to be overridden.
